= How to use Git

In a way, Git is like Dropbox or Google Drive,
but with far greater powers and complexity.
Hence this guide.
Git is available in the command line, as a standalone graphical interface, and is integrated in development tools such as Eclipse and Visual Studio.

== Command line

First, open your terminal.

****
[horizontal]
*Windows*:: Windows key -> Git Bash
*Mac OS X*:: Finder -> Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal
****

Then, go to the repository for this course.

----
cd ~/COMP1000
----

[cols="1a,3a"]
|===
|*To...*
|*... follow these steps:*

|*Submit work*

. Work
. Stage
. Commit
. Push
|*Work* by saving files inside the course repository `COMP1000`,
or copy files into that folder.

*Stage* your work by selecting files to add to the next commit (snapshot).
Git _tracks changes_ to the files you stage.

****
To stage all files currently in the folder...

----
git add .
----

To stage `an_arbitrary_file`

----
git add an_arbitrary_file
----
****

*Commit* to record a snapshot of the files staged earlier, and describe what you did.

----
git commit -m "Finished lab 1"
----

[TIP]
====
You can stage and commit tracked files in one step:

----
git commit -am "Finished lab 1"
----
====

*Push* to upload commits to your remote repository.

----
git push origin master
----

|*Confirm submission*

. Show history
. Locate `origin/master`
|*Show history* of commits.

----
gitk --all &
----

*Locate `origin/master`* in the commit history to see when you last submitted work.
If it's at the top, you pushed successfully.
If it's missing (or not at the top), I don't have your latest changes, and you need to push.

|*Receive updates*

. Fetch
. Merge
. Check

|*Fetch* to download updates from me.

----
git fetch --all
----

*Merge* `upstream/master` to combine my updates with your work.

----
git merge upstream/master
----

[TIP]
====
To fetch and merge in one step:
----
git pull upstream master
----
====

*Check* the output for `errors` to see if you need fix anything.

Git may complain that a file `would be overwritten by merge.`
This means that you haven't _staged_ or _committed_ those file(s) yet,
and git is preventing you from losing that work.
Stage and commit the file(s), and try to merge again.

Git may warn about a merge `CONFLICT`.
This means that we both made different changes to the same lines in the _conflicting_ files.

Examine all conflicting file(s).
You will notice lines with `<<<<<` or `=====` or `>>>>>` that weren't there before.
These _merge conflict markers_ show where (and how) changes created conflict.
Although you may remove them manually, git has options to assist you.

If you want to keep your version of a `conflicting_file`

----
git checkout --ours conflicting_file
----

If you want to use my version of a `conflicting_file`

----
git checkout --theirs conflicting_file
----

If you want to mix and match changes, use a merge tool (installed separately).

----
git mergetool conflicting_file
----

Finally, to fix the merge conflict, stage and commit all conflicting files (after you've fixed them).
////

Look at what changed.

----
git status
----

****
*Changes to be committed*::
*Changes not staged for commit*::
*Untracked files*::
****
////

== Git GUI

First, open Git GUI.

****
*Windows*: Windows key -> Git GUI

*Mac OS X*:

Finder -> Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal

----
git gui
----

Locate the Git icon in the Dock.

Right click Git -> Options -> Keep in Dock
****

Next, go to the repository for this course.

Stage and commit the file(s) and try to merge again.

Git GUI may warn about merge conflicts.
This means that we both made different changes to the same lines in _conflicting_ files.

To fix the merge conflict, follow the instructions described in the command line section.
